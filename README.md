# Keylogger
Keylogger implemented in C++

To use this code, follow these steps:

Save the code in a file with a .cpp extension (e.g., keylogger.cpp).

Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the .cpp file.

Compile the code using a C++ compiler, such as GCC or Microsoft Visual C++. For example, if you are using GCC, run the following command:

g++ keylogger.cpp -o keylogger

This will generate an executable file named keylogger.

Execute the generated executable file to run the keylogger. For example:

./keylogger

The keylogger will start capturing and recording keystrokes. Press any key to exit the program.
